  'Unknown Status of HOA':
    '∙ Unknown Status of HOA:  It doesn’t appear as though we’ve received information about the finances of the property’s HOA. Reviewing the finances of the HOA is important because it appears as though your HOA is responsible for maintaining important structural components of your unit. Without reviewing the HOA finances, you won’t know how likely you are to be assessed a large one-time charge (or receive a large HOA fee increase) in the case of required repairs',
  'HOA Funding Issues':
    '∙ HOA Funding Issues: Based on our look through of the HOA reserve study, it appears as though your HOA is underfunded. This means that at the current HOA fee, the HOA will not be able to cover its future planned repair obligations. This is surprisingly common for HOAs we review; the average we usually see is 40% - 60% funded. What this means is that over time, you should expect your HOA dues to increase, or to be charged a one-time assessment if large expenses arise. Take a look through the reserve study to learn more and be sure to ask us if you have any questions!',
  'Unknown Roof Quality':
    '∙ Unknown Roof Quality: There doesn’t seem to be enough information on the roof to make an assessment on its quality.  Before making a binding commitment to purchase the property, we believe it’s valuable to get an inspector to examine the roof so you know what you’re getting yourself into. Replacing a roof can be very expensive (potentially $30,000 or more), which you should take into consideration as you’re making the offer.',
  'Likely Roof Repair/Replacement':
    '∙ Likely Roof Repair/Replacement: It seems as though the inspector recommended the roof requires significant repairs or replacement. You should certainly take that into account when making your offer. While the inspector sometimes makes an estimate on what they expect the repairs to cost, you should always have the worst case in mind, which in the case of a roof could cost you $30,000 or more to replace.',
  'Potential Foundation Issues':
    '∙ Potential Foundation Issues: It appears as though the foundation shows some signs of damage/strain but the inspector was unable to make a definitive assessment. When this happens, we believe it’s valuable to) get a structural engineer to look at the property before making a binding offer to purchase the home. This is because foundation issues can be some of the most expensive problems to fix on a home. While in many cases foundation problems can be inexpensively addressed, we’ve had some customers who’s only option was the to raise the whole house to fix the foundation (costing upwards of $100,000). You’ll want to know what you’re dealing with.',
  'Flood Zone':
    '∙ Flood Zone: The property is in a flood hazard area, which means that a government authority has concluded that the home has a higher than average likelihood of experiencing flood-related damage. Depending on the type of flood zone, you may be required by your lender to purchase additional insurance, but in all cases you should be prepared for flood-related damage over the course of a 30-yr mortgage.',
  'Fire Zone':
    '∙ Fire Zone: The property is in a very high fire hazard area, which means that a government authority has concluded that the home has a higher than average likelihood of experiencing fire-related damage. Depending on the type of fire zone, you may be required by your lender to purchase additional insurance (or pay a local fire prevention surcharge), but in all cases you should be prepared for fire-related damage over the course of a 30-yr mortgage.',
  'Seismic Zone':
    '∙ Seismic Zone: The property is in a seismic hazard area, which means that a government authority has concluded that the home has a higher than average likelihood of experiencing earthquake-related damage. While many countries require that homeowners get earthquake insurance to protect yourself, the US does not. Earthquake insurance is expensive, but it’s expensive because the potential cost of repairing earthquake damage is also high. You should be prepared for earthquake related damage at least once over a 30-yr mortgage, and we believe you should plan to take  steps to reduce the risk wherever possible. This includes making necessary retrofits, making sure you know how to turn off the gas (and have a nearby wrench if it’s not an automatic shut-off), making sure the water heater is properly strapped, among other things.',
  'Long Distance from City Core':
    '∙ Long Distance from City Core: It appears this home is relatively far from the city core. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing (and is often where affordability is best!), homes further from the core are more sensitive to changes in the economy.  When the economy is booming, homes far from the core aren’t that much cheaper than those in the core, but when the economy goes sour, in many cases, it can be very difficult to find buyers and homes may be sold for steep discounts (as, more often than not, the few buyers still in the market take advantage of these dips to purchase closer to the core). In 2008-2010, some homes lost over 60% of their value as a result of this effect. As a result of this significant risk, Landed is likely going to be unable to support you in this home purchase.  Your account manager will reach out by the next business day to explain further.  If you need to make an offer ASAP, make sure to do so with the appropriate contingencies in place in case Landed cannot support.',
  'Flipped Property':
    '∙ Flipped Property:  This property was flipped, meaning that an investor bought it for a cheaper price, made some relatively quick (often cosmetic) changes to it, and put it back on the market. We always urge buyers to exercise extreme caution when buying flipped properties. Often, property flippers buy rundown properties and avoid making the expensive structural repairs that led to the property being sold at a discount when they purchased it.  Instead they focus on upgrading visual items like floors, doors, appliances, fixtures; items that are much less expensive to fix. We recommend that you get your own inspection with flipped properties (even if one is provided to you), and be vigilant in your investigation.  These are often the riskiest properties we help educators buy.',
